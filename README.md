# Niyantri Coffee - Website

This directory contains a static 3-page storefront site built with Tailwind CSS utility classes. Pages:

- index.html  (Home with hero, testimonials, shop teaser)
- about.html  (Brand story)
- contact.html (Contact form + location)

Notes and defaults:
- Tailwind CSS utility classes are used directly in HTML (no separate CSS files).
- Image placeholders use the required format: src="https://pixabay.com/get/g27cb6592eeee28368c25eb5dbcea4e2ff538afa94ee0b343707976f45210ecd1cf586b1a5f929883e5e8b23a45ecc7118dbe60bcae4fc55d72899f094b925d29_640.jpg".
- The footer includes a 3-column layout on desktop and stacks on mobile.
- All links and buttons include smooth transitions via Tailwind classes.
- The homepage hero is full-viewport with a centered message and action buttons.
- The site uses a warm/comforting aesthetic with earthy tones.

If you want to customize content, swap image placeholders with real assets and tweak text in the relevant HTML files.
